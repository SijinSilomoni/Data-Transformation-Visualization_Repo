# Data-Transformation_Repo

Performed basic data cleaning to ensure accuracy, then segmented the visuals by country, region, and market to provide detailed geographical insights. We analyzed shipping data by visualizing the percentage of orders by ship mode and created comprehensive visualizations showing sales across cities, states, regions, and markets. Additionally, we generated data tables for each visualization and compiled everything into an interactive sales report, enabling stakeholders to explore and analyze the data with ease.
